## Guerrilla Marketing Tactics (80% of effort)

### 1. Community Seeding
- **Hacker News** - Launch with "Show HN: I built a local-first document signing tool"
- **Reddit** - Post in r/privacy, r/selfhosted, r/opensource, r/cryptography
- **Dev.to / Hashnode** - "Why I built OVD" technical deep-dive
- **Twitter/X** - Thread explaining the problem + solution, tag privacy influencers

### 2. GitHub Presence
- **Awesome Lists** - Submit to awesome-privacy, awesome-selfhosted, awesome-crypto
- **GitHub Topics** - Tag with trending topics: ed25519, document-signing, privacy-tools
- **Discussions** - Engage in related repos (noble-ed25519, etc.)
- **Stars Campaign** - Ask early users to star if they find it useful

### 3. Content Marketing (Zero Budget)
- **"Sign This" Challenge** - Encourage people to sign manifestos, predictions, commitments
- **Use Case Threads** - "5 things you can prove with OVD" content series
- **Comparisons** - "OVD vs DocuSign vs PGP" honest comparison posts
- **Tutorial Videos** - Short Loom/YouTube demos (under 2 min)

### 4. Stunt Marketing
- **Sign a Prediction** - Publicly sign a prediction about tech/markets, verify later
- **Open Source Pledge** - Sign your open source contributions
- **Whistleblower Use Case** - Position for journalists verifying sources
- **"Prove You Wrote It First"** - Appeal to creators worried about AI attribution

### 5. Partnership & Integration
- **Obsidian Plugin** - Build plugin for note-taking app users
- **VS Code Extension** - Sign code files from IDE
- **CLI Tool** - For developers who prefer terminal
- **Browser Extension** - Sign web content

### 6. Word of Mouth Triggers
- **Fingerprint as Identity** - Encourage users to put fingerprint in Twitter bio
- **Verification Badges** - "Verified with OVD" badges for websites
- **Signed README** - Encourage repos to include signed manifests
